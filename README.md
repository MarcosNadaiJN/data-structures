# Data Structures

Even though i already use data structures daily at work, i decided to study them again, to properly understand how they REALLY work under the hood, and to do so, i am implementing my own version of them, of course they are not super optmized or anything,
but the idea here is to understand how they work, so i can have a better judgment in the future, on which one should i use in which situation. And i am going to use Java, because it's the Language i am more familiar with.

## What will you find here

There are a lot of data structures, but my idea here is to learn and understand the most importante ones, the ones I'm actually going to use at my personal projects, or at work at some point. 

Data Structures i am going to study:
 - Linked Lists
 - Stacks
 - Queues
 - Trees
 - Graphs

Each data structure will have a section with an explanation on how they work, in theory and in practice, with images, GIF's etc... 

## But why ??
I like to learn things, we all do, but i was lacking motivation to actually sit down and start studing, so i remembered the one thing i like to do, more than i like learn things, it is to explain it to someone (i like to talk, okay), so i had an idea that motivated me to study again, an idea that no one had before, i decided to start a Youtube Channel.
I know okay, i know...

With that in mind, i thought about a bunch of videos that i wanted to make, about data structures, how git works, Java Threads, Generics, Design Patterns etc etc..., but the problem is, making those videos take A LOT of time, and i don't have that time (yet), but i still want to learn those things, yeah that's the idea, trick my brain to learn, so i can talk about it 
(i REALLY like to talk okay...) so i decided to write about it, to still learn even tough i don't have time to make the videos right now.

Despite of already use java data structures daily at work, i decided to study them again, to properly understand how they REALLY work under the hood, and to do so, i am implementing my own version of them, of course they are not super optmized or anything,
but the idea here is to understand how they work, so i can have a better judgment in the future, on which one should i use in which situation.
